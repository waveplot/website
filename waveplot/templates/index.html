    WavePlot is an audio imaging system designed to make it easier for editors of the MusicBrainz to identify tracks.

    You can use the search box on the left to look up one of the recordings in our database, or alternatively select "List Recordings".

    "Extreme DRs" showcases one of the more interesting features of WavePlots - automatic DR Meter compatible dynamic range levels.

<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>WavePlot currently has two main components, called WavePlotImager and scanner.py. WavePlotImager is a program written in the C programming language, which can calculate a WavePlot for almost any audio file. scanner.py is a Python script file which recurses over some directory filled with music, runs WavePlotImager on each file, and submits it to the server.</p>

<p>If you're interested in writing your own submission tool, scanner.py is the place to borrow code from. I'm going to be writing plugins for Picard and beets, among others, in the near future, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>In order to submit any WavePlots, you need an editor ID. You can get one of these by hitting "Register!" on the left, agreeing to cookies on the site, and providing a valid email address. The activation code will then get emailed to you - it is the number in the link in the email. You'll need to click the link, and then copy and paste that number into the terminal/command prompt when scanner.py asks for it.</p>

<p>Happy submitting!</p>
